# sqlalchemy

We recommend to look at the [documentation of sqlalchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) and [documentation of flask-restful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies

```bash
poetry init
```

poetry add flask-restful
```
